# Definition of (distributed) source positions: 
# position, time-delay, centre frequency, and amplitude
#
# (comment line is indicated by # or % as first character)
#
# Symbols: 
# XSRC= x-coordinate of source point [meter]
# YSRC= y-coordinate of source point [meter] (vertical direction)
# TD= excitation time (time-delay) for source node [s]
# FC= centre frequency of source signal [Hz]
# AMP= maximum amplitude of source signal
#
# Optional:
# SOURCE_AZIMUTH= if SOURCE_TYPE is 4, source_azimuth is 
#                 the angle between the y- and x-direction
# SOURCE_TYPE= if source_type is set here, the value SOURCE_TYPE
#	       in the input file is ignored.
#
# Parameters for each source node (one source node per line):
#
# XSRC	YSRC	TD	FC	AMP	SOURCE_AZIMUTH	SOURCE_TYPE
